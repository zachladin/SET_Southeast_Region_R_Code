	title = {Soil Calcium Availability Limits Forest Songbird Productivity and Density},
	volume = {128},
	doi = {10.1525/auk.2011.10283},
	abstract = {Forest soils in many areas of the world are becoming increasingly acidified, in part because of atmospheric deposition of strong acids produced by the burning of fossil fuels. Soil acidification and subsequent calcium depletion of forest soils in eastern North America have the potential to affect forest songbird populations negatively by reducing the availability of calcium-rich food items that are critical for reproduction. Nonetheless, little experimental evidence exists for the purported relationship between soil calcium and avian reproduction. Our objective was to use an experimental and observational study to determine how forest songbird-habitat quality is related to soil calcium availability. We experimentally elevated soil calcium using limestone sand and observed a 1.8-fold increase in Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) territory density, larger clutch sizes and more nests, but no effects on egg characteristics. The observational study of 14 forested sites in central Pennsylvania likewise showed positive relationships between natural soil calcium levels and Ovenbird territory density, clutch size, and nest density. Again, no relationships existed between soil calcium and eggshell characteristics. Snails are a critical calcium source for many breeding birds, and we suspect that snails are the link between soils and birds because snail abundance increased with liming and was positively correlated with soil calcium. We conclude that Ovenbird habitat quality is related to soil calcium, that birds on our sites were calcium-limited, and that reduced soil calcium could play an important role in bird declines in acidified forests.

	abstract = {Altricial nestlings are under strong selection pressures to optimize digestive efficiency because this is one of the main factors affecting nestling growth and survival. Bird species vary in their ability to assimilate different nutrients and current theory predicts that nestlings should also be able to adjust their nutritional physiology to feeding frequency. Variation in parental provisioning to nestlings would select for flexibility in nestling digestive physiology, which would allow maximization of nutrient assimilation. In the present study, by making use of a brood parasite-host study system in which great spotted cuckoo nestlings (Clamator glandarius) are reared by magpie (Pica pica) host foster parents when sharing the nest with host nestlings, we tested several predictions of the adaptive digestive efficiency paradigm. A hand-feeding experiment was employed in which we fed both great spotted cuckoo and magpie nestlings with exactly the same diet simulating one food abundance period and one food deprivation period. The results obtained show that cuckoo nestlings ingested more food, gained significantly more weight during the abundance period, and assimilated a higher proportion of the ingested food than magpie nestlings. These results demonstrate for the first time that cuckoo nestlings enjoy digestive adaptations that favour a rapid processing of the ingested food, thereby maximizing their intake rate but without decreasing digestive efficiency.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 111, 280-289.},

Half-lives of C in breath, plasma, and {RBCs} were 4.4 +/- 2.1 h, 24.8 +/- 12.3 h and 10.9 +/- 3.2 days, respectively, for yellow-rumped warblers. delta(13)C of breath, plasma, {RBCs} and feces from wild-caught golden-crowned kinglets (Regulus satrapa), ruby-crowned kinglets ( R. calendula) and gray catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) indicated that they had maintained an isotopically consistent diet for an extended period of time. However, delta(13)C of breath and plasma indicated that white-throated sparrows ( Zonotrichia albicollis) had recently expanded their diet to include a C-4 dietary component. Likewise, delta(13)C of breath, plasma, {RBCs} and feces indicated that some wild-caught yellow-rumped warblers had consumed foods with a more enriched protein signature prior to their arrival on Block Island, and since arrival, they had consumed mostly northern bayberry ( Myrica pensylvanica).

	doi = {10.1002/rcm.4095},
	abstract = {In the prolonged absence of catastrophic disturbance, ecosystem retrogression occurs, and this involves increased nutrient limitation, and reduced aboveground and belowground ecosystem processes rates. Little is known about how the nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios (delta(15)N and delta(13)C) of plants, soils and consumer organisms respond to retrogression in boreal forests. We investigated a 5000 year chronosequence of forested islands in the boreal zone of northern Sweden, for which the time since lightning-induced wildfire increases with decreasing island size, leading to ecosystem retrogression. For this system, tissue delta(15)N of three abundant plant species (Betula pubescens, Vaccinium myrtillus and Pleurozium schreberi) and humus all increased as retrogression proceeded. This is probably due to enhanced ecosystem inputs of N by biological fixation, and greater dependency of the plants on organic N during retrogression. The delta(13)C of B. pubescens and plant-derived humus also increased during retrogression, probably through nutrient limitation increasing plant physiological stress. Unlike the plants, delta(15)N of invertebrates (lycosid spiders and ants) did not increase during retrogression, probably because of their partial dependence on aquatic-derived prey that had a variable delta(15)N signature. The delta(13)C of the invertebrates increased as retrogression proceeded and converged towards that of an aquatic prey source (chironomid flies), suggesting increased dependence on aquatic-derived prey during retrogression. These results show that measurement of delta(15)N and delta(13)C of plants, soils, and consumers across the same environmental gradient can provide insights into environmental factors that drive both the aboveground and belowground subsystems, as well as the linkages between them.

This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology, then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns, disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns, altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises. Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for studying pattern–process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short (years to decades) and long term (centuries and beyond). Future research should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers. Ecologists should make a renewed and concerted effort to understand and anticipate the causes and consequences of changing disturbance regimes.},

Fecal samples were collected from adult males, adult females, fledglings, and nestlings. Leaf- and planthoppers (Homoptera) and spiders (Araneae) predominated numerically in samples. Spider prey was most diverse, with eight families represented. True bugs (Hemiptera) and wasps, bees, and ants (Hymenoptera) were only minor components of the gnatcatcher diet. Gnatcatcher adults selected prey to feed their young that was larger than expected given the distribution of arthropod size available in their environment, and chicks were provisioned with larger prey items and significantly more grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera) and spiders than adults consumed themselves. Both adults and young consumed more sessile than active prey. Further studies are needed to determine whether arthropods sampled in coastal sage scrub that are common in fecal samples are good indicators of California gnatcatcher habitat.},

	doi = {10.1111/gcb.12042},
	abstract = {Global climate warming is predicted to lead to global and regional changes in the distribution of organisms. One influential approach to test this prediction using temporally repeated mapping surveys of organisms was suggested in a seminal paper by Thomas \& Lennon (1999, Nature). The Thomas \& Lennon approach corrects observed changes in the range margin for changes in the range size, and thus potentially controls for other broad-scale environmental changes between surveys, however the approach does not necessarily account for potential biases in sampling effort. To verify whether the issue of variation in sampling effort affects empirical estimates of shifts in range margin, we reanalyzed all three published studies exploring range margin changes of breeding birds in Great Britain ({GB}), Finland, and New York State ({NY}). Accounting for changes in survey effort on range margins lowered the estimated shift for breeding birds in New York, but the shift remained statistically significant. For Great Britain and Finland, for which no direct estimate of survey effort is available, we used species richness (a strong correlate of survey effort in New York) as a proxy and found that in both cases the estimated shift in range margin was significantly reduced and became nonsignificant. To understand how robust the approach is to sampling biases, we use a simulation model to show that the Thomas \& Lennon approach is, under certain conditions, sensitive to changes in detection probability (probability to detect true occupancy) which in turn may be affected by changes in surveying effort between surveys. We thus found evidence that temporal changes in the distribution of breeding birds based on repeated mapping surveys may be inflated by changes in survey effort along range boundaries. We discuss possible approaches to deal with this issue in the analysis and design of national or regional surveys.},

	abstract = {Inter-individual diet variation within populations is likely to have important ecological and evolutionary implications. The diet-fitness relationships at the individual level and the emerging population processes are, however, poorly understood for most avian predators inhabiting complex terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we use an isotopic approach to assess the trophic ecology of nestlings in a long-lived raptor, the Bonelli's eagle Aquila fasciata, and investigate whether nestling dietary breath and main prey consumption can affect the species' reproductive performance at two spatial scales: territories within populations and populations over a large geographic area. At the territory level, those breeding pairs whose nestlings consumed similar diets to the overall population (i.e. moderate consumption of preferred prey, but complemented by alternative prey categories) or those disproportionally consuming preferred prey were more likely to fledge two chicks. An increase in the diet diversity, however, related negatively with productivity. The age and replacements of breeding pair members had also an influence on productivity, with more fledglings associated to adult pairs with few replacements, as expected in long-lived species. At the population level, mean productivity was higher in those population-years with lower dietary breadth and higher diet similarity among territories, which was related to an overall higher consumption of preferred prey. Thus, we revealed a correspondence in diet-fitness relationships at two spatial scales: territories and populations. We suggest that stable isotope analyses may be a powerful tool to monitor the diet of terrestrial avian predators on large spatio-temporal scales, which could serve to detect potential changes in the availability of those prey on which predators depend for breeding. We encourage ecologists and evolutionary and conservation biologists concerned with the multi-scale fitness consequences of inter-individual variation in resource use to employ similar stable isotope-based approaches, which can be successfully applied to complex ecosystems such as the Mediterranean.},

	abstract = {Little is understood about how environmental heterogeneity influences the spatial dynamics of sexual selection. Within human-dominated systems, habitat modification creates environmental heterogeneity that could influence the adaptive value of individual phenotypes. Here, we used the gray catbird to examine if the ecological conditions experienced in the suburban matrix ({SM}) and embedded suburban parks ({SP}) influence reproductive strategies and the strength of sexual selection. Our results show that these habitats varied in a key ecological factor, breeding density. Moreover, this ecological factor was closely tied to reproductive strategies such that local breeding density predicted the probability that a nest would contain extra-pair offspring. Partitioning reproductive variance showed that while within-pair success was more important in both habitats, extra-pair success increased the opportunity for sexual selection by 39\% at higher breeding densities. Body size was a strong predictor of relative reproductive success and was under directional selection in both habitats. Importantly, our results show that the strength of sexual selection did not differ among habitats at the landscape scale but rather that fine-scale variation in an ecological factor, breeding density, influenced sexual selection on male phenotypes. Here, we document density-dependent sexual selection in a migratory bird and hypothesize that coarse-scale environmental heterogeneity, in this case generated by anthropogenic habitat modification, changed the fine-scale ecological conditions that drove the spatial dynamics of sexual selection.},

	abstract = {Interspecific parasitic chicks are usually fed more than the smaller host young with whom they share the nest. This could be due to parasitic chicks having evolved exaggerated features that are preferred by the adults to the features present in their own young (the supernormal stimulus hypothesis). Alternatively, the success of parasitic chicks could be due to them being better competitors. We tested these hypotheses by studying the interaction between brown-headed cowbird chicks, Molothrus ater, and a common small host, the yellow warbler, Dendroica petechia. Parasitic chicks begged. more intensively than the host's young and received most of the feeds. The relative height reached by the begging chicks of both species was the most important variable in determining their feeding success. Being larger and begging intensively, brown-headed cowbirds were better able to reach higher than the host's young, but at equal heights parasitic chicks were no better than the host's young at gaining feeds. It is suggested that the success of the brown-headed cowbirds when parasitizing yellow warblers is due to them physically out-competing the smaller young of their hosts, and not to them evoking a stronger response from the hosts by being a supernormal stimulus.},

Since 1969, my colleagues and I have been studying migratory songbird populations in their breeding quarters at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in north-central New Hampshire, {USA}, and since 1986, in their winter quarters in the Greater Antilles (Jamaica). Long-term data on the abundance and demography of these populations, coupled with experimental tests of mechanisms, indicate that processes operating in the breeding area (e.g. density-dependent fecundity, food limitation) are sufficient to limit and regulate the local abundance of these species. At the same time, limiting factors operating in the non-breeding season (e.g. climate-induced food limitation in winter quarters and especially mortality during migration) also have important impacts on migrant populations. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that limiting processes during the winter period can carry over into the breeding season and affect reproductive output. These findings clearly demonstrate that to understand changes in abundance of long-distance migrant species requires knowledge of events operating throughout the annual cycle, which presents a challenge to researchers, managers and others concerned with the welfare of these species.},

The existence and stability of equilibria are provided, and an extinction threshold condition is derived which depends on patch dynamics (patch destruction and creation) and metapopulation dynamics (patch colonization and extinction). These results refine threshold conditions given by previous metapopulation models. By comparing landscapes with different spatial heterogeneities with respect to weighted long-term patch occupancies, we conclude that the pattern of a landscape is of overwhelming importance in determining metapopulation persistence and patch occupancy. We show that the same conclusion holds when a rescue effect is considered. We also derive a stochastic differential equations ({SDE}) model of the Itô type based on our deterministic model. Our simulations reveal good agreement between the deterministic model and the {SDE} model.},

	abstract = {Grassland bird species continue to decline steeply across North America. Road-based surveys such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey ({BBS}) are often used to estimate trends and population sizes and to build species distribution models for grassland birds, although roadside survey counts may introduce bias in estimates because of differences in habitats along roadsides and in off-road surveys. We tested for differences in land cover composition and in the avian community on 21 roadside-based survey routes and in an equal number of adjacent off-road walking routes in the grasslands of southern Alberta, Canada. Off-road routes (n = 225 point counts) had more native grassland and short shrubs and less fallow land and road area than the roadside routes (n = 225 point counts). Consequently, 17 of the 39 bird species differed between the two route types in frequency of occurrence and relative abundance, measured using an indicator species analysis. Six species, including five obligate grassland species, were more prevalent at off-road sites; they included four species listed under the Canadian federal Species At Risk Act or listed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada: Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii), the Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius ornatus), and {McCown}'s Longspur (Rhynchophanes mccownii). The six species were as much as four times more abundant on off-road sites. Species more prevalent along roadside routes included common species and those typical of farmland and other human-modified habitats, e. g., the European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), the Black-billed Magpie (Pica hudsonia), and the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus). Differences in avian community composition between roadside and off-road surveys suggest that the use of {BBS} data when generating population estimates or distribution models may overestimate certain common species and underestimate others of conservation concern. Our results highlight the need to develop appropriate corrections for bias in estimates derived from roadside sampling, and the need to design surveys that sample bird communities across a more representative cross-section of the landscape, both near and far from roads.},

	abstract = {1. Demographic data from both breeding and non-breeding periods are needed to manage populations of migratory birds, many of which are declining in abundance and are of conservation concern. Although habitat associations. and to a lesser extent, reproductive biology, are known for many migratory species. few studies have measured survival rates of these birds at different parts of their annual cycle. 2. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and Akaike's information criterion model selection were used to investigate seasonal variation in survival of a Nearctic - Neotropical migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens. Seasonal and annual survival,were estimated from resightings of colour-ringed individuals on breeding grounds in New Hampshire, {USA} from 1986 to 2000 and on winter quarters in Jamaica, West Indies from 1986 to 1999. Warblers were studied each year during the May-August breeding period in New Hampshire and during the October-March overwinter period in Jamaica. 3. In New Hampshire, males had higher annual survival (0.51 +/- 0.03) and recapture probabilities (0.93 +/- 0.03) than did females (survival: 0.40 +/- 0.04 recapture: 0.87 +/- 0.06). In Jamaica, annual survival (0.43 +/- 0.03) and recapture (0.95 +/- 0.04) probabilities did not differ between sexes. Annual survival and recapture probabilities of young birds (i.e. yearlings in New Hampshire and hatch-year birds in Jamaica) did not differ from adults. indicating that from the time hatch-year individuals acquire territories on winter quarters in mid-October, they survive as well as adults within the same habitat. 4. Monthly survival probabilities during the summer (May-August) and winter (October-March) stationary periods were high: 1.0 for males in New Hampshire, and 0.99 +/- 0.01 for males in Jamaica and for females in both locations. 5. These annual and seasonal survival estimates were used to calculate warbler survival for the migratory periods. Monthly survival probability during migration ranged from 0.77 to 0.81 +/- 0.02. Thus, apparent mortality rates were at least 15 times higher during migration compared to that in the stationary periods, and more than 85\% of apparent annual mortality of D. caerulescens occurred during migration. 6. Additional data from multiple species, especially measures of habitat-specific demography and dispersal, will improve our understanding of the relative impacts of the breeding, migratory, and winter periods on population dynamics of migratory birds and thus enhance future conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {The species composition, abundance, and isotopic signature of millipedes (Myriapoda, Diplopoda) were investigated in seven biotopes of Kaluzhskie Zaseki State Nature Reserve. Nine Diplopoda species were found in total, and the local species diversity (within a sampling plot) reached seven species. The Diplopoda tissues were similar to the plant litter in the isotopic composition of nitrogen (delta15N was by 0.4\% per hundred higher, on average), but were more strongly enriched in heavy carbon (delta13C was by 4\% per hundred higher, on average). Removal of mineral carbon from the cuticle reduced delta13C of Diplopoda by about 1.4\% per hundred on average. Differences in the delta15N and delta13C values between the species did not exceed 2.5 per hundred. Differences in the isotopic compositions of the considered species are insignificant, and thus, it is impossible to distinguish particular trophic guilds in the Diplopoda community. Analysis of the published data confirmed that isotopic differentiation of millipedes was much less pronounced than in other investigated groups of soil animals. Hence, millipedes of the deciduous forest form a uniform trophic group.},

	abstract = {Dynamics of populations may be synchronized at large spatial scales, indicating driving forces acting beyond local scales, but may also vary locally as a result of site-specific conditions. Conservation measures for fragmented and declining populations may need to address such local effects to avoid local extinction before measures at large spatial scales become effective. To assess differences in local population dynamics, we aimed to determine the demographic drivers controlling population trends in three remaining populations of the Northern Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe in the Netherlands, as a basis for conservation actions. An integrated population model ({IPM}) was fitted to field data collected in each site in 2007-2011 to estimate fecundity, survival and immigration. Sites were 40-120km apart, yet first-year recruits were observed to move between some of the sites, albeit rarely. All three populations were equally sensitive to changes in fecundity and first-year survival. One population was less sensitive to adult survival but more sensitive to immigration. A life table response experiment suggested that differences in immigration were important determinants of differences in population growth between sites. Given the importance of immigration for local dynamics along with high philopatry, resulting in low exchange between sites, creating a metapopulation structure by improving connectivity and the protection of local populations are important for the conservation of these populations. Site-specific conservation actions will therefore be efficient and, for the short term, we propose different site-specific conservation actions.},

	shorttitle = {Improving species distribution models},
	abstract = {Species distribution models ({SDMs}) are important tools for forecasting the potential impacts of future environmental changes but debate remains over the most robust modelling approaches for making projections. Suggested improvements in {SDMs} vary from algorithmic development through to more mechanistic modelling approaches. Here, we focus on the improvements that can be gained by conditioning {SDMs} on more detailed data. Specifically, we use breeding bird data from across Europe to compare the relative performances of {SDMs} trained on presence-absence data and those trained on abundance data. Species distribution models trained on presence-absence data, with a poor to slight fit according to Cohen's kappa, show an average improvement in model performance of 032 ({SE} +/- 012) when trained on abundance data. Even those species for which models trained on presence-absence data are classified as good to excellent show a mean improvement in Cohen's kappa score of 005 ({SE} +/- 001) when corresponding {SDMs} are trained on abundance data. This improved explanatory power is most pronounced for species of high prevalence. Our results illustrate that even using coarse scale abundance data, large improvements in our ability to predict species distributions can be achieved. Furthermore, predictions from abundance models provide a greater depth of information with regard to population dynamics than their presence-absence model counterparts. Currently, despite the existence of a wide variety of abundance data sets, species distribution modellers continue to rely almost exclusively on presence-absence data to train and test {SDMs}. Given our findings, we advocate that, where available, abundance data rather than presence-absence data can be used to more accurately predict the ecological consequences of environmental change. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of informative baseline data sets. We therefore recommend the move towards increased collection of abundance data, even if only coarse numerical scales of recording are possible.},

	abstract = {Despite intensive recent research on the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird population., our understanding of underlying demographic causes of population declines is limited. We reviewed avian demography in relation to habitat fragmentation. Then, through a meta-analysis, we compared specific demographic responses by forest birds to habitat fragmentation, providing a general perspective of factors that make some species and populations more. vulnerable to fragmentation than others. We obtained data from the scientific literature on dispersal, survival, fecundity, and nesting success of birds. Birds were divided into subgroups on the basis of region, nest site, biogeographical history, and migration strategy. Species most sensitive to fragmentation were ground- or open-nesters nesting in shrubs or trees. Residents were equally sensitive to fragmentation in the Nearctic and Palearctic regions, but Nearctic migrants were more sensitive than Palearctic migrants. Old World species were less sensitive than New World species, which was predicted based on the history of forest fragmentation on these two continents. Pairing success was the variable most associated with fragmentation, suggesting an important role of dispersal. Fledgling number or condition, timing of nesting, and clutch size were not associated with sensitivity to fragmentation, suggesting that negative fragmentation effects on birds do not generally result from diminished food resources with increasing level of fragmentation. Future studies on demographic responses of birds to habitat fragmentation-would be more effective if based on a combination of measures that can distinguish among the demographic mechanisms underlying population changes related to habitat fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle exhibits a remarkable flexibility in the usage of fuel in response to the nutrient intake and energy demands of the organism. In fact, increased physical activity and fasting trigger a transcriptional programme in skeletal muscle cells leading to a switch from carbohydrate to lipid oxidation. Impaired metabolic flexibility has been reported to be associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, but it is not known whether the disability to adapt to metabolic demands is a cause or a consequence of these pathological conditions. Inasmuch as a poor nutritional environment during early life is a predisposing factor for the development of metabolic diseases in adulthood, in the present study, we aimed to determine the long-term effects of maternal malnutrition on the metabolic flexibility of offspring skeletal muscle. To this end, the transcriptional responses of the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles to fasting were evaluated in adult rats born to dams fed a control (17\% protein) or a low-protein (8\% protein, protein restricted ({PR})) diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. With the exception of reduced body weight and reduced plasma concentrations of {TAG}, {PR} rats exhibited a metabolic profile that was the same as that of the control rats. In the fed state, {PR} rats exhibited an enhanced expression of key regulatory genes of fatty acid oxidation including {CPT}1a, {PGC}-1 alpha, {UCP}3 and {PPAR} alpha and an impaired expression of genes that increase the capacity for fat oxidation in response to fasting. These results suggest that impaired metabolic inflexibility precedes and may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders associated with early malnutrition.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope mixing models are increasingly used to quantify consumer diets, but may be misused and misinterpreted. We address major challenges to their effective application. Mixing models have increased rapidly in sophistication. Current models estimate probability distributions of source contributions, have user-friendly interfaces, and incorporate complexities such as variability in isotope signatures, discrimination factors, hierarchical variance structure, covariates, and concentration dependence. For proper implementation of mixing models, we offer the following suggestions. First, mixing models can only be as good as the study and data. Studies should have clear questions, be informed by knowledge of the system, and have strong sampling designs to effectively characterize isotope variability of consumers and resources on proper spatio-temporal scales. Second, studies should use models appropriate for the question and recognize their assumptions and limitations. Decisions about source grouping or incorporation of concentration dependence can influence results. Third, studies should be careful about interpretation of model outputs. Mixing models generally estimate proportions of assimilated resources with substantial uncertainty distributions. Last, common sense, such as graphing data before analyzing, is essential to maximize usefulness of these tools. We hope these suggestions for effective implementation of stable isotope mixing models will aid continued development and application of this field.},

In fact, in some instances these techniques have yielded remarkable insights into the foraging preferences and migrations of birds. Despite these advances and the potential of the approach, it is possibly still not as widely used as might be expected. In this paper we aim to illustrate the potential of the approach in the hope of encouraging more avian ecologists to think again about how these techniques might provide insights in the systems on which they work. We discuss some of the principles behind the approach, and review some of the more recent ornithological studies that have used stable isotope techniques to trace trophic pathways or infer migratory origins. We follow this by discussing some of the latest ideas on how stable isotopes may be used to generate community metrics and close by detailing the important assumptions and caveats that should be considered before undertaking any studies using this technique.},

We present a new hypothesis for the adaptive significance of song learning in songbirds, suggesting that this specialized form of vocal development provides an indicator mechanism by which females can accurately assess the quality of potential mates. This hypothesis expands on the established idea that song earn provide an indicator of male quality, but it explicitly links the variation in song expression that females use to choose mates to the developmental processes through which song is acquired. How well a male sings-reflected in repertoire size or in other learned features of a male's singing behavior-provides an honest indicator of quality because the timing of song learning and, more importantly, the timing of the development of brain structures mediating learning corresponds to a period in development during which young songbirds are most likely to undergo nutritional stress. This correspondence means that song learning can provide a sensitive indicator of early developmental history in general, which in turn reflects various aspects of the phenotypic and genotypic quality of a potential mate.},

	abstract = {A major justification of environmental management research is that it helps practitioners, yet previous studies show it is rarely used to inform their decisions. We tested whether conservation practitioners focusing on bird management were willing to use a synopsis of relevant scientific literature to inform their management decisions. This allowed us to examine whether the limited use of scientific information in management is due to a lack of access to the scientific literature or whether it is because practitioners are either not interested or unable to incorporate the research into their decisions. In on-line surveys, we asked 92 conservation managers, predominantly from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, to provide opinions on 28 management techniques that could be applied to reduce predation on birds. We asked their opinions before and after giving them a summary of the literature about the interventions’ effectiveness. We scored the overall effectiveness and certainty of evidence for each intervention through an expert elicitation process—the Delphi method. We used the effectiveness scores to assess the practitioners’ level of understanding and awareness of the literature. On average, each survey participant changed their likelihood of using 45.7\% of the interventions after reading the synopsis of the evidence. They were more likely to implement effective interventions and avoid ineffective actions, suggesting that their intended future management strategies may be more successful than current practice. More experienced practitioners were less likely to change their management practices than those with less experience, even though they were not more aware of the existing scientific information than less experienced practitioners. The practitioners’ willingness to change their management choices when provided with summarized scientific evidence suggests that improved accessibility to scientific information would benefit conservation management outcomes.

	abstract = {Effects of diflubenzuron (a chitin-synthesis inhibiting insecticide) application on diets of forest birds were evaluated in eastern West Virginia in 1986. Nine species of songbirds were collected from May through July from treated and untreated plots. Gut contents from each specimen were removed and 10 arthropod taxa were identified. The percentage biomass comprised by each food taxon and total gut biomass was determined for each specimen. The diets of five species were significantly different between treated and untreated plots. In general, biomass of Lepidoptera larvae was reduced and biomass of other orders (Homoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, etc.) was greater at treated sites. In addition, two species displayed reduced total gut biomass at treated sites. These data show that while diflubenzuron is not directly toxic to vertebrates, birds are affected indirectly through reduced availability of Lepidoptera larvae. Birds possessed differing capabilities to compensate for these diflubenzuron-induced food reductions. Most birds adjusted by switching prey, while others consumed less food. Resident species experienced less impact than did migrants.},

	abstract = {Avian nest success is largely determined by predation, but factors affecting the abundance of potential nest predators are rarely studied. We used an information-theoretic approach to assess relative support for models including invertebrate biomass, mammalian nest predator abundance, and percent cover at nests as explanatory variables for nest success of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla (L., 1766)) and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina (J.F. Gmelin, 1789)). We ranked models including local vegetation characteristics and landscape composition at two spatial scales (100 and 2000 m) as explanatory variables for the abundance of mammalian nest predator groups and for prey biomass. The nest success of Ovenbirds was best explained by a positive association with percent cover by forbs and seedlings, whereas a positive relationship with prey biomass best explained the nest success of Wood Thrush. Most mammal genera were associated with landscape composition within 100 m of the study sites, and most were positively associated with housing density. Prey biomass was best explained by a positive association with less intensive agriculture within 2000 m. Implementing silvicultural techniques that preserve important habitat features within fragmented forests, limiting housing density within 100 m, and increasing the amount of less intensive agriculture within 2000 m of forest fragments may improve nest success for forest songbirds.},

	abstract = {Forecasting the consequences of climate change is contingent upon our understanding of the relationship between biodiversity patterns and climatic variability. While the impacts of climate change on individual species have been well-documented, there is a paucity of studies on climate-mediated changes in community dynamics. Our objectives were to investigate the relationship between temporal turnover in avian biodiversity and changes in climatic conditions and to assess the role of landscape fragmentation in affecting this relationship. We hypothesized that community turnover would be highest in regions experiencing the most pronounced changes in climate, and that these patterns would be reduced in human-dominated landscapes. To test this hypothesis, we quantified temporal turnover in avian communities over a 20-year period using data from the New York State Breeding Atlases collected during 1980-85 and 2000-05. We applied Bayesian spatially-varying intercept models to evaluate the relationship between temporal turnover and temporal trends in climatic conditions and landscape fragmentation. We found that models including interaction terms between climate change and landscape fragmentation were superior to models without the interaction terms; suggesting that the relationship between avian community turnover and changes in climatic conditions was affected by the level of landscape fragmentation. Specifically, we found weaker associations between temporal turnover and climatic change in regions with prevalent habitat fragmentation. We suggest that avian communities in fragmented landscapes are more robust to climate change than communities found in contiguous habitats because they are comprised of species with wider thermal niches and thus are less susceptible to shifts in climatic variability. We conclude that highly fragmented regions are likely to undergo less pronounced changes in composition and structure of faunal communities as a result of climate change, whereas those changes are likely to be greater in contiguous and unfragmented habitats.

Conservation planners consider the species to be at risk, although evidence of population decline has thus far been localized or inconclusive. In order to assess the status of Bicknell's Thrush in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, we conducted point-count surveys on 40 forested, high-elevation routes from 1993 to 2003. Non-linear regression oil aggregate counts revealed a 7\% annual decline over this period (P {\textless} 0.1). We discuss possible threats to Bicknell's Thrush, including winter habitat loss, pollution of mountain ecosystems, climate change, and human intrusion during breeding. A range-wide monitoring program that incorporates new survey methods is needed to help identify limiting factors and reduce potential sources of error and bias. This study underscores the importance of efforts to monitor and conserve Bicknell's Thrush.},

Hermit Thrushes (Catharus guttatus) in southeastern Louisiana are highly frugivorous during winter but forage exclusively on arthropods just prior to spring migration. We hypothesized that this switch to an exclusively arthropod diet would lead to an increase in fat reserves compared to a frugivorous diet, and that fat birds would initiate migration sooner and display more migratory activity than lean birds. We tested these hypotheses on captive Hermit Thrushes maintained on either an arthropod only diet or a mixed fruit and arthropod diet and measured changes in fat score, body mass, and nocturnal migratory activity (Zuguuruhe) from February to April 2000. We found that the arthropod-only treatment led to greater body mass and greater amounts of subcutaneous fat than the mixed fruit and arthropod treatment by the third week of the experiment. Despite those differences, body mass was not correlated with intensity of Zugunruhe. We also did not find a significant difference in intensity or onset of Zugunruhe between treatments. We concluded that because Hermit Thrushes are short-distance migrants, large fat reserves are not crucial for their migration. Consequently, fruit and arthropods appear to be equivalent with respect to migratory behavior.},

In the present study, we show that cognitive function in later life does seem affected by prenatal undernutrition. We found that at age 56 to 59, men and women exposed to famine during the early stage of gestation performed worse on a selective attention task, a cognitive ability that usually declines with increasing age. We hypothesize that this decline may be an early manifestation of an accelerated cognitive aging process.},

	abstract = {The global decline in biodiversity as a result of urbanization remains poorly understood. l-Whereas habitat destruction accounts for losses at the species level, it may not explain diversity loss at the community level, because urban centers also attract synanthropic species that do not necessarily exist in wildlands. Here the suggest an alternative framework jot understanding this phenomenon: the competitive exclusion of native, non-synanthropic species by invasive species. We use data from two urban centers (Phoenix and Baltimore) and two taxa (birds and spiders) to link diversity loss with reduced community evenness among species in urban communities. This reduction in evenmess may be caused by a minority of invasive species dominating the majority of the resources, consequently excluding nonsynanthropic species that could otherwise adapt to urban conditions. We use foraging efficiency as a mechanism to explain the loss of diversity Thus, to understand the effects of habitat conversion oil biodiversity, and to sustain species-rich communities, future research should give more attention to interspecific interactions ill urban settings.},

	volume = {81},
	doi = {10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.01981.x},
	abstract = {1. Environmental degradation can change resource use strategies of animals and thereby affect survival and fitness. Arctic herbivores may be especially susceptible to the effects of such environmental change because their rapid growth rates demand high-quality forage, which may be limited as environmental conditions deteriorate. We studied the consequences of a trophic cascade, driven by Lesser Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) overgrazing on the south-west coast of Hudson Bay, Canada, which has caused tidal marsh ({TM}) degradation and the reduction in high-quality forage plants, on gosling growth and resource use. 2. We compared resource use and body size of goslings that inhabited tidal and freshwater marsh ({FM}) to determine how current foraging strategies influence growth and to test the hypothesis that during early growth goslings require and so consume high-quality {TM} plants, but that during later growth they may switch to foraging in lower-quality {FM}. 3. To investigate gosling resource use throughout growth, we measured once a week for 28 days the body size of goslings as well as stable isotope ratios (d34S, d15N and d13C) in multiple tissues of goslings that were collected from both {TM} and nearby {FM}. We also measured the stable isotope ratios in forage plants sampled along transects and from gosling foreguts. We used an isotope-mixing model to determine the contribution of {FM} plants to gosling tissues. 4. Contrary to the proposed hypothesis, goslings inhabiting {FM} or {TM} primarily consumed {FM} plants during early growth. Furthermore, goslings that foraged extensively in {FM} had similar growth rates and grew to a similar size and body mass, as goslings that foraged in the degraded {TM}. However, goslings that currently inhabit freshwater or {TM} were significantly smaller than goslings that inhabited {TM} in the 1980s prior to habitat degradation. 5. Consequences of smaller overall body size include decreased survival and fecundity for arctic-nesting geese. The ability of phenotypically plastic responses to sustain persistence is limited by reaction norms and the extent of environmental change. Current research is assessing whether those limits have been reached in this system.},

	abstract = {I provide a detailed description of an arthropod sampling technique, "branch clipping," and evaluate its efficacy in measuring food availability for three foliage-gleaning migratory warbler species wintering in Jamaica. I incorporated foraging observations into the sampling protocol to facilitate a match between the distribution of branch-clip samples and the distribution of warbler foraging attacks over available microhabitats. Where the match was imprecise, I weighted blanch clip samples accordingly. Foraging observations indicated that most for-aging maneuvers used by the warblers were directed at pre), located on foliage, which are likely to be well sampled by branch clipping. Published diet analyses permitted the elimination of prey taxa and sizes that were not eaten by the warblers, and suggested that nearly all of the items eaten were captured by branch clipping. Habitat-specific warbler attack rates, which can be used as independent evaluations of food availability measurements, closely matched prey density as estimated by branch clips across three habitat types (citrus orchard, coffee plantation, and dry limestone forest). These data suggest that branch clipping effectively measured food availability for foliage-gleaning warblers in Jamaica. The method is probably also well suited for other foliage-gleaning species, particularly in habitats and seasons in which birds feed largely on prey residing oil or flying near leaf surfaces. Branch clipping is probably ill suited for species that feed heavily on either large, fast filing insects (e.g., Odonata), or on large masses of flies (e.g., Chilonomidae) that seldom land on forest foliage.},

	doi = {10.1016/S1470-160X(01)00015-2},
	abstract = {For an ecological monitoring program to be successful over the long-term, the perceived benefits of the information must justify the cost. Financial limitations will always restrict the scope of a monitoring program, hence the program’s focus must be carefully prioritized. Clearly identifying the costs and benefits of a program will assist in this prioritization process, but this is easier said than done. Frequently, the true costs of monitoring are not recognized and are, therefore, underestimated. Benefits are rarely evaluated, because they are difficult to quantify. The intent of this review is to assist the designers and managers of long-term ecological monitoring programs by providing a general framework for building and operating a cost-effective program. Previous considerations of monitoring costs have focused on sampling design optimization. We present cost considerations of monitoring in a broader context. We explore monitoring costs, including both budgetary costs, what dollars are spent on, and economic costs, which include opportunity costs. Often, the largest portion of a monitoring program budget is spent on data collection, and other, critical aspects of the program, such as scientific oversight, training, data management, quality assurance, and reporting, are neglected. Recognizing and budgeting for all program costs is therefore a key factor in a program’s longevity. The close relationship between statistical issues and cost is discussed, highlighting the importance of sampling design, replication and power, and comparing the costs of alternative designs through pilot studies and simulation modeling. A monitoring program development process that includes explicit checkpoints for considering costs is presented. The first checkpoint occurs during the setting of objectives and during sampling design optimization. The last checkpoint occurs once the basic shape of the program is known, and the costs and benefits, or alternatively the cost-effectiveness, of each program element can be evaluated. Moving into the implementation phase without careful evaluation of costs and benefits is risky because if costs are later found to exceed benefits, the program will fail. The costs of development, which can be quite high, will have been largely wasted. Realistic expectations of costs and benefits will help ensure that monitoring programs survive the early, turbulent stages of development and the challenges posed by fluctuating budgets during implementation.},

	title = {Long-term coevolution between avian brood parasites and their hosts},
	volume = {89},
	doi = {10.1111/brv.12075},
	abstract = {Coevolutionary theory predicts that the most common long-term outcome of the relationships between brood parasites and their hosts should be coevolutionary cycles based on a dynamic change selecting the currently least-defended host species, given that when well-defended hosts are abandoned, hosts will be selected to decrease their defences as these are usually assumed to be costly. This is assumed to be the case also in brood parasite-host systems. Here I examine the frequency of the three potential long-term outcomes of brood parasite-host coevolution (coevolutionary cycles, lack of rejection, and successful resistance) in 182 host species. The results of simple exploratory comparisons show that coevolutionary cycles are very scarce while the lack of rejection and successful resistance, which are considered evolutionary enigmas, are much more frequent. I discuss these results considering (i) the importance of different host defences at all stages of the breeding cycle, (ii) the role of phenotypic plasticity in long-term coevolution, and (iii) the evolutionary history of host selection. I suggest that in purely antagonistic coevolutionary interactions, such as those involving brood parasites and their hosts, that although cycles will exist during an intermediate phase of the interactions, the arms race will end with the extinction of the host or with the host acquiring successful resistance. As evolutionary time passes, this resistance will force brood parasites to use previously less suitable host species. Furthermore, I present a model that represents the long-term trajectories and outcomes of coevolutionary interactions between brood parasites and their hosts with respect to the evolution of egg-rejection defence. This model suggests that as an increasing number of species acquire successful resistance, other unparasitized host species become more profitable and their parasitism rate and the costs imposed by brood parasitism at the population level will increase, selecting for the evolution of host defences. This means that although acceptance is adaptive when the parasitism rate and the costs of parasitism are very low, this cannot be considered to represent an evolutionary equilibrium, as conventional theory has done to date, because it is not stable.},

Model-based scenarios linking climate, land use and biodiversity can be exceptionally useful tools for decision support in this context. We present a modeling framework that links climate projections, private land use decisions including farming, forest and urban uses and the abundances of common birds as an indicator of biodiversity. Our major innovation is to simultaneously integrate the direct impacts of climate change and land use on biodiversity as well as indirect impacts mediated by climate change effects on land use, all at very fine spatial resolution. In addition, our framework can be used to evaluate incentive-based conservation policies in terms of land use and biodiversity over several decades. The results for our case study in France indicate that the projected effects of climate change dominate the effects of land use on bird abundances. As a conservation policy, implementing a spatially uniform payment for pastures has a positive effect in relatively few locations and only on the least vulnerable bird species.},

	abstract = {Organisms that breed multiple times must trade off resources between current and future reproduction. In many species, sexual selection can lead to reduced levels of immune function in males because they invest heavily in current reproduction at the expense of self-maintenance. Much less is known about whether the same trend is seen in species such as the brood-parasitic brown-headed cowbird Molothrus ater (hereafter "cowbird"), in which females invest heavily in current reproduction. We examined two measures of immune function (bactericidal capacity of the plasma and the phytohemagglutinin swelling response) and baseline levels of corticosterone in both sexes of the cowbird and its nonparasitic relative the red-winged blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus (hereafter "redwing") during the breeding and subsequent nonbreeding seasons. We found that female cowbirds exhibited significantly lower levels of both measures of immune function than did male cowbirds and female redwings during the breeding season but had comparable levels during the nonbreeding season. Female redwings, in contrast, exhibited higher or comparable levels of immune function when compared with male redwings during the breeding season. In conjunction with published accounts documenting significantly higher rates of mortality for female cowbirds compared with male cowbirds and the fact that female cowbirds produce very high numbers of eggs (25-65) in a single breeding season, our results suggest that female cowbirds invest heavily in current reproduction at the expense of self-maintenance.},

	abstract = {Birds that migrate to the neotropics have experienced dramatic population decreases over the last few decades. Although the transformation of their wintering habitats has been related to such decreases, several neotropical migrants are tolerant of human disturbances and winter in human-altered habitat. We surveyed a neotropical city broadly to evaluate how migrant birds respond to urbanization, finding that urbanization has a negative effect on communities of migrant birds: species richness and density of migrants decreased with urbanization. Although we recorded a significant decrease in the total number of individual neotropical migrants toward the center of the city, we found no differences among species when we assessed possible effects of the distance from the city's edge by species. Only tree cover had a positive significant relationship with both species richness and bird abundance. Our results show that urbanization can have an even greater negative effect on communities of neotropical migrant birds than for those of resident birds. However, some migrants that used the urban habitats we studied are of conservation concern, indicating that urbanization can act as a two-edged sword, affecting several migratory species negatively while offering winter habitats to others.},

	abstract = {Predictive models of species distributions are typically developed with data collected along roads. Roadside sampling may provide a biased (nonrandom) sample; however, it is currently unknown whether roadside sampling limits the accuracy of predictions generated by species distribution models. We tested whether roadside sampling affects the accuracy of predictions generated by species distribution models by using a prospective sampling strategy designed specifically to address this issue. We built models from roadside data and validated model predictions at paired locations on unpaved roads and 200 m away from roads (off road), spatially and temporally independent from the data used for model building. We predicted species distributions of 15 bird species on the basis of point-count data from a landbird monitoring program in Montana and Idaho (U.S.A.). We used hierarchical occupancy models to account for imperfect detection. We expected predictions of species distributions derived from roadside-sampling data would be less accurate when validated with data from off-road sampling than when it was validated with data from roadside sampling and that model accuracy would be differentially affected by whether species were generalists, associated with edges, or associated with interior forest. Model performance measures (kappa, area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic plot, and true skill statistic) did not differ between model predictions of roadside and off-road distributions of species. Furthermore, performance measures did not differ among edge, generalist, and interior species, despite a difference in vegetation structure along roadsides and off road and that 2 of the 15 species were more likely to occur along roadsides. If the range of environmental gradients is surveyed in roadside-sampling efforts, our results suggest that surveys along unpaved roads can be a valuable, unbiased source of information for species distribution models.},

	shorttitle = {Variation in discrimination factors (Delta N-15 and Delta C-13)},
	abstract = {The use of stable isotopic techniques to study animal diets and trophic levels requires a priori estimates of discrimination factors (Delta C-13 and Delta N-15, also called fractionation factors), which are the differences in isotopic composition between an animal and its diet. Previous studies have shown that these parameters depend on several sources of variation (e.g. taxon, environment, tissue) but diet as a source of variation still needs assessment. We conducted an extensive review of the literature (66 publications) concerning estimates of animal-diet Delta C-13 (n = 290) and Delta N-15 (n = 268). We analysed this data set to test the effect of diet isotopic ratio on the discrimination factor, taking into account taxa, tissues, environments and lipid extraction treatments. Our results showed differences among taxonomic classes for Delta C-13, but not for Delta N-15, and significant differences among tissues for both Delta C-13 and Delta N-15. We found a significant negative relationship between both, Delta C-13 and Delta N-15, with their corresponding diet isotopic ratios. This relationship was found also within taxonomic classes for mammals (Delta C-13 and Delta N-15), birds (Delta C-13), fishes (Delta C-13 and Delta N-15) and invertebrates (Delta C-13 and Delta N-15). From these relationships, we propose a method to calculate discrimination factors based on data on diet isotope ratios (termed the 'Diet-Dependent Discrimination Factor', {DDDF}). To investigate current practice in the use of discrimination factors, we reviewed studies that used multi-resource isotopic models. More than 60\% of models used a discrimination factor coming from a different species or tissues, and in more than 70\% of models, only one Delta C-13 or Delta N-15 was used for all resources, even if resources had very different isotopic ratios. Also, we estimated {DDDFs} for the studies that used isotopic models. More than 40\% used Delta N-15 values and more than 33\% used Delta C-13 values differing {\textgreater} 2 parts per thousand from estimated {DDDFs}. Synthesis and applications. Over the last decade, applied ecologists have discovered the potential of stable isotopes for animal diet reconstruction, but the successful adoption of the method relies on a good estimation of discrimination factors. We draw attention to the high variability in discrimination factors, advise caution in the use of single discrimination factors in isotopic models, and point to a method for obtaining adequate values for this parameter when discrimination factors cannot be measured experimentally. Future studies should focus on understanding why discrimination factors vary as a function of the isotopic value of the diet.},

	volume = {24},
	issn = {1051-0761},
	abstract = {Distributional patterns across the United States of five avian community breeding-season characteristics-community biomass, richness, constituent species' vulnerability to extirpation, percentage of constituent species' global abundance present in the community (conservation index, {CI}), and the community's position along the ecological gradient underlying species composition (principal curve ordination score, {PC})-were described, their covariation was analyzed, and projected effects of climate change on the characteristics and their covariation were modeled. Higher values of biomass, richness, and {CI} were generally preferred from a conservation perspective. However, higher values of these characteristics often did not coincide geographically; thus regions of the United States would differ in their value for conservation depending on which characteristic was chosen for setting conservation priorities. For instance, correlation patterns between characteristics differed among Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. Among the five characteristics, community richness and the ecological gradient underlying community composition ({PC}) had the highest correlations with longitude, with richness declining from east to west across the contiguous United States. The ecological gradient underlying composition exhibited a demarcation near the 100th meridian, separating the contiguous United States grossly into two similar-sized avian ecological provinces. The combined score ({CS}), a measure of species' threat of decline or extirpation, exhibited the strongest latitudinal pattern, declining from south to north. Over similar to 75\% of the lower United States, projected changes in June temperature and precipitation to year 2080 were associated with decreased averaged values of richness, biomass, and {CI}, implying decreased conservation value for birds. The two ecological provinces demarcated near the 100th meridian diverged from each other, with projected changes in June temperatures and precipitation from the year 2000 to 2080 suggesting increased ecological dissimilarity between the eastern and western halves of the lower United States with changing climate. Anticipated climate-related changes in the five characteristics by 2080 were more weakly correlated with latitude or longitude then the responses themselves, indicating less distinct geographic patterns of characteristic change than in the characteristics themselves. Climate changes projected for 2080 included geographic shifts in avian biomass, {CS}, and {PC} values, a moderate overall decline in {CI}, and general decline in species richness per site.},

	abstract = {Ecological processes near habitat edges often differ from processes away from edges. Yet, the generality of ''edge effects'' has been hotly debated because results vary tremendously. To understand the factors responsible for this variation, we described nest predation and cowbird distribution patterns in forest edge and forest core habitats on 36 randomly selected plots in three states in the midwestern United States. We tested four hypotheses that may explain the variation and mechanisms responsible for edge effects among the 36 plots: (1) the landscape context, (2) the local predator community, (3) the local bird (host-prey) community, and (4) the nest site microhabitat structure. We used artificial nests baited with quail and clay eggs to determine nest predation patterns and predators and used point count surveys to determine cowbird and host abundance in forest edge and forest core habitats. Raccoons, opossums, canids, and birds accounted for most predation of artificial nests. Neither local host abundance nor mean nest concealment of artificial nests significantly influenced nest predation rates in habitat edge or in habitat core. Nest predation was significantly greater in highly fragmented landscapes than in unfragmented landscapes and was significantly higher in edge habitats than in core habitats. However, detection of edge effects varied, depending upon landscape type. Higher predation rates in edge habitats were detected in highly and moderately fragmented landscapes, but not in unfragmented landscapes. Both mammalian and avian predator groups contributed to higher predation rates along edges in highly and moderately fragmented landscapes. Cowbird abundance was significantly related to host abundance, but the effect of hosts varied depending upon habitat type. In edge habitats, cowbird abundance was negatively associated with host abundance in all three landscapes studied. By contrast, cowbird abundance was positively associated with host abundance in core habitats. Once the effects of host abundance were removed, cowbird abundance in core habitat was greater in highly fragmented landscapes than in moderately and unfragmented landscapes, but did not differ between the latter two. In edge habitat, cowbird abundance did not differ between landscapes, but abundance in edges tended to be highest in the highly fragmented landscape and lowest in the unfragmented landscape. Cowbird abundance did not vary between edge and core habitat in any of the landscapes studied. We suggest that the first approximation to predicting the impact of agricultural or permanently managed edges on forest songbird reproductive success is to assess habitat characteristics at the landscape scale. Given geographic location, local factors such as host abundance and predator composition should be assessed.},

	abstract = {1. Individual variability in prey preferences can have marked effects on many demographic parameters from individual survival and fecundity to the vital rates of entire populations. A population level response is ultimately determined by individual prey choices; however, the effect of individual dietary choice is often overlooked. 2. We determined prey choice by individual consumers, light-bellied Brent geese Branta Branta, during the overwintering period. Two hundred and eighty-one individuals were sampled at distinct temporal points over two winters. Stable isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen for blood cells and blood plasma, from each sampled individual were measured. Isotopic ratios for potential prey items were also measured. 3. delta N-15 and delta C-13 for blood samples were both significantly different between sample months. Generally we found a decrease in both isotopic ratios during the course of the winter. All potential prey items were also isotopically distinct. Multisource mixing models (({ISOSOURCE})) were used to determine the range of possible contribution to the diet of individuals. 3. During early winter, diet consisted almost exclusively of sea grass Zostera spp. The level of Zostera spp. in the diet dropped until mid-winter, and was supplemented by the utilization of green algae Ulva lactuca, and Enteromorpha spp., and terrestrial grasses. Terrestrial grass comprised an increasing proportion of the diet in late winter, representing virtually the exclusive food source by April. 4. By examining intrapopulation variability in resource utilization we highlight a number of ecologically important factors not addressed by previous population level studies.},

However, little is known about how, the most intense human activity, urbanization, alters food webs and trophic structure in biological communities. Studies of the Phoenix area, situated amid the Sonoran Desert, reveal some surprising alterations in the control of trophic dynamics. Species composition is radically altered, and resource subsidies increase and stabilize productivity. Changes in productivity dampen seasonal and yearly fluctuations in specics diversity, elevate, abundances, and alter feeding behaviors of some key urban species. In urban systems contrast to the trophic systems in outlying deserts, which are dominated by limiting resources-predation by birds becomes the dominant force controlling arthropods on plants. Reduced predation risk elevates the abundance of urban birds and alters their foraging behavior such that they exert increased top-down effects on arthropods. Shifts in control of food web dynamics are probably common in urban ecosystems, and are influenced by complex human social processes and feedbacks.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10021-002-0151-3},
	abstract = {Although it is generally acknowledged that invasions by exotic plant species represent a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem stability, little attention has been paid to the potential impacts of these invasions on nutrient cycling processes in the soil. The literature on plant-soil interactions strongly suggests that the introduction of a new plant species, such as an invasive exotic, has the potential to change many components of the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), water, and other cycles of an ecosystem. I have reviewed studies that compare pool sizes and flux rates of the major nutrient cycles in invaded and noninvaded systems for invasions of 56 species. The available data suggest that invasive plant species frequently increase biomass and net primary production, increase N availability, alter N fixation rates, and produce litter with higher decomposition rates than co-occurring natives. However, the opposite patterns also occur, and patterns of difference between exotics and native species show no trends in some other components of nutrient cycles (for example, the size of soil pools of C and N). In some cases, a given species has different effects at different sites, suggesting that the composition of the invaded community and/or environmental factors such as soil type may determine the direction and magnitude of ecosystem-level impacts. Exotic plants alter soil nutrient dynamics by differing from native species in biomass and productivity, tissue chemistry, plant morphology, and phenology. Future research is needed to (a) experimentally test the patterns suggested by this data set; (b) examine fluxes and pools for which few data are available, including whole-site budgets; and (c) determine the magnitude of the difference in plant characteristics and in plant dominance within a community that is needed to alter ecosystem processes. Such research should be an integral component of the evaluation of the impacts of invasive species.},

	volume = {149},
	doi = {10.1007/s00442-006-0424-1},
	abstract = {Interspecific brood parasitism in birds presents a special problem for the host because the parasitic offspring exploit their foster parents, causing them to invest more energy in their current reproductive effort. Nestling brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) are a burden to relatively small hosts and may reduce fledgling quality and adult survival. We documented food-provisioning rates of one small host, the prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea), at broods that were similar in age (containing nestlings 8-9 days old), but that varied in composition (number of warbler and cowbird nestlings) and mass, and measured the effect of brood parasitism on offspring recruitment and adult returns in the host. The rate of food provisioning increased with brood mass, and males and females contributed equally to feeding nestlings. Controlling for brood mass, the provisioning rate was higher for nests with cowbirds than those without. Recruitment of warbler fledglings from unparasitized nests was 1.6 and 3.7 times higher than that of fledglings from nests containing one or two cowbirds, respectively. Returns of double-brooded adult male and female warblers decreased with an increase in the number of cowbirds raised, but the decrease was more pronounced in males. Reduced returns of warbler adults an recruitment of warbler fledglings with increased cowbird parasitism was likely a result of reduced survival. Cowbird parasitism increased the warblers' investment in current reproductive effort, while exerting additional costs to current reproduction and residual reproductive value. Our study provides the strongest evidence to date for negative effects of cowbird parasitism on recruitment of host fledglings and survival of host adults.},

In both species, changes in delta(13)C (C cinclus) or delta(15)N (C mexicanus) in female plasma relative to red blood cells indicated a dietary shift during laying that was not observed in males. Eurasian dippers increased prey consumption as breeding approached, shifting from primarily trichopteran insect larvae to ephemeropterans and plecopterans. In American dippers, egg-laying females switched to feeding at a higher trophic level by consuming more fish. Eggs derived from higher trophic level diets contained more mercury (American dipper), polychlorinated biphenyls and some organochlorines, especially {DDT} metabolites. The results demonstrate how dietary changes during egg laying accompany the demands for egg production with consequences for contaminant deposition in avian eggs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Earlier studies based on bioclimatic envelope models and bird atlas data from 1974 to 1989 have suggested that northern-boreal bird species may face considerable range contractions in Northern Europe by 2080. Using new bird atlas data from Finland compiled in 2006-2010, we show that the ranges of these northern-boreal bird species have already contracted by 27\%, on average, compared with 1974-89. The majority (21) of the studied 27 northern-boreal bird species showed significant contractions of ranges and/or northwards shifts. Thus the range changes of northern species are in the same direction as the predictions of species-climate change models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1650/CONDOR-13-045.1},
	abstract = {Many empirical studies have shown that forest-breeding songbirds, and Neotropical migrants in particular, suffer greater rates of nest predation and nest parasitism in smaller forest patches and in fragmented landscapes. To compare the performance of different metrics of spatial habitat configuration resulting from deforestation, we studied nest predation and nest parasitism rates at 200 Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) nests in eight forest fragments ranging from 82 to 9,171 ha in central Virginia, {USA}. We analyzed nest parasitism rates using logistic regression and we analyzed daily nest predation rates under a multistate competing risks design. For both analyses we compared the performance of 16 covariates, 11 of which related to the spatial configuration of habitat (e.g., patch size, distance to edge, percent core forest in proximity to nest) and 5 of which were unrelated to habitat (e.g., year, serial date, nest height). Distance to agriculture gained the greatest support in analyses of nest predation and suggested that elevated predation rates are manifest primarily within 50 m of edges; at 5, 10, and 20 m, respectively, the estimated predation rates were 87\%, 76\%, and 68\%. In contrast, biogeographic region received the greatest support in analyses of nest parasitism, which also showed increasing rates of Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism with percent agricultural land and road density within 500 m of a nest. Among regions, the greatest difference seemed to be a virtual absence of nest parasitism along the Blue Ridge in the absence of disturbance (agriculture or road incursion) whereas the other two biogeographic regions showed 20-50\% rates of nest parasitism as background rates. Interactive models between spatial configuration metrics and region gained little support from nest predation analyses, but considerable support from the nest parasitism analyses, suggesting regional context plays a more important role in nest parasitism than in nest predation at these central Virginia sites.},

We provided additional food (mealworms and fat) to randomly selected territories near the smelter ({\textless}2 km, polluted area) and in the more distant sites ({\textgreater}4 km, control area). Additional food resulted in higher nestling growth and survival in both areas. Exposure of nestlings to heavy metals was estimated by measuring fecal concentrations of copper and lead. In the polluted area, extra food benefited most those broods that would have accumulated the highest lead concentrations. Nestlings in the polluted area exhibited higher asymmetry of primaries, suggesting that they experienced higher stress, but stress hormone (corticosterone) concentrations and metabolic rates (oxygen consumption) did not differ between the polluted and control areas. Contrary to our expectation, the positive effect of additional food on breeding success was greater in the unpolluted area. The results suggest that different amounts of invertebrate food (biomass) in the two areas cannot wholly explain differences in the breeding success of P. major.},

	volume = {96},
	doi = {10.1111/j.1095-8312.2008.01127.x},
	abstract = {The intestinal microbiota determines the effectiveness of digestion in vertebrates, and is influenced by the external environment (mainly the diet), gut characteristics, and phylogeny. Avian brood-parasitic nestlings of the sub-family Cuculinae develop in nests of phylogenetically distant passerines and can be fed with the host diet. If the shaping of bacterial communities is dominated by phylogenetic constraints, and therefore the microbiota of parasitic nestlings differs from that of host nestlings, the energy and micronutrients that parasites and hosts obtain from a similar amount of food would be different. In this case, the bacterial communities of parasitic and host nestlings would have important consequences with respect to brood parasite development. By experimentally creating mixed broods of magpies (Pica pica) and great spotted cuckoos (Clamator glandarius), we investigated their cloacal microbiota using ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. We found significant differences in bacterial assemblages of the parasitic and host nestlings, although none of the phylotypes were specific in either great spotted cuckoos or magpies. Cuckoos presented more complex communities, which could help the brood parasitic life style and allow the digestion of food provided by different potential hosts. Moreover, the intestinal morphology is different between the two species due to phylogenetic differences in the two taxa, which would influence the dissimilar bacterial assemblages. The detected differences in microbiota of great spotted cuckoo and magpie nestlings, which might occur in other brood parasite-host systems, may imply a lower digestion efficiency in parasites. Thus, the higher level requirements of cuckoo nestlings may be explained, at least in part, by cuckoos having a suboptimal bacterial community for processing the host diet.

Mathematical mixing models are used to estimate the proportional contributions of food sources to the isotopic composition of the tissues of a consumer, which reflect the assimilated diet. This paper reviews basic mixing models and how they work; additional refinements also are described that include addressing uncertainty, larger numbers of sources, combining sources, concentration effects, and Bayesian statistical frameworks. Information is provided on where to access software for the various models. Numerous examples are cited to show application of these models in the mammal research literature.},

	abstract = {Aim of this paper is to assess the fate of metapopulations described by spatially explicit models. To this end, we first present an interacting particle system ({IPS}) where individuals of a single species compete logistically at the local scale and can move among patches according to various dispersal kernels. As the {IPS} is a complex stochastic system, it is impossible to determine the persistence–extinction boundaries in any relevant parameter space with analytical methods or numerical continuation techniques. We thus resort to a heuristic method that lets us determine the boundaries as space–time percolation thresholds with a relatively modest computational effort. Such boundaries are qualitatively consistent with those we obtained with spatial implicit modelling. In particular, we find that the intermediate dispersal principle, namely that globally persistent metapopulations correspond to dispersal rates that are neither too low nor too high, turns out to be very robust even in this explicit context. However, the quantification of the boundaries strongly depends upon the number of patches, the dispersal kernels and the border conditions. Finally, we show that there exists a scaling law that relates the number of species lost in a fragmented landscape to the number of patches. Thus, the law allows a rough estimation of the cost of destroying a patch.},

	abstract = {We studied the effects of brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and other factors on food provisioning rates of Swainson's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii), a secretive and poorly understood species of conservation concern. We used time-lapse video systems to collect provisioning data at 25 nests, nine of which were parasitized by Brown-headed Cowbirds. We found strong relationships between feeding rate and brood size with increases from 2.0 feeding visits/hr for nests with a single Swainson's Warbler nestling to 3.0/hr for broods of four. We also found an effect of nestling age with 1.9 visits/hr early and 3.2 visits/hr late in the nestling period. The relationships between cowbird parasitism and provisioning were complex. Nests with brood size of one or three that contained a single cowbird nestling had greater provisioning rates (2.5 and 3.3 visits/hr, respectively) than non-parasitized nests (2.0 and 2.6 visits/hr, respectively). Nests with two cowbirds and no Swainson's Warbler young had greater provisioning rates (3.4 visits/hr) than those with two warbler young (2.4 visits/hr), or one warbler and one cowbird (2.6 visits/hr). The increase in provisioning rate with nestling age was more pronounced with two cowbird nestlings present than in nests with zero or one cowbird nestling. These results suggest that parasitized nests, especially those with multiple cowbird nestlings, can impose greater energetic demands on parents. Food limitation may constrain the ability of Swainson's Warblers to adequately care for both their own nestlings and cowbird young. Received 10 April 2009. Accepted 2 September 2009.},

	abstract = {Modest dietary restriction ({DR}) prolongs life in a wide range of organisms, spanning single-celled yeast to mammals. Here, we report the use of recent techniques in nutrition research to quantify the detailed relationship between diet, nutrient intake, life-span, and reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster. Caloric restriction ({CR}) was not responsible for extending lifespan in our experimental flies. Response surfaces for lifespan and fecundity were maximized at different protein-carbohydrate intakes, with longevity highest at a protein-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1:16 and egg-laying rate maximized at 1:2. Lifetime egg production, the measure closest to fitness, was maximized at an intermediate P:C ratio of 1:4. Flies offered a choice of complementary foods regulated intake to maximize lifetime egg production. The results indicate a role for both direct costs of reproduction and other deleterious consequences of ingesting high levels of protein. We unite a body of apparently conflicting work within a common framework and provide a platform for studying aging in all organisms.},

	abstract = {Trends toward increased temperatures, reduced sea ice extent, and longer open water seasons have resulted in changing Arctic ecosystem dynamics. Expected changes include shifts in distribution and abundance of prey species for seabirds and marine mammals. Using stable isotope analysis, we studied spatial and interannual variation in ringed seal (Pusa hispida) feeding ecology in Hudson Bay in relation to environmental variables, between 2003 and 2010. Ringed seal muscle and hair samples collected from Arviat and Sanikiluaq, Nunavut, were analyzed for stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (N-15) and carbon (C-13). Seals from western Hudson Bay (Arviat) had higher N-15 and lower C-13 than seals from eastern Hudson Bay (Sanikiluaq), and stable isotope ratios varied interannually within each region. Peak N-15 occurred in years with spring air temperatures between approximately -5 degrees C and -2 degrees C. This temperature range was characteristic of warm years in western Hudson Bay and cool years in eastern Hudson Bay. We hypothesize that the high N-15 observed in ringed seals is indicative of greater importance of capelin (Mallotus villosus) in ringed seal diet. A comparison of ringed seal isotopic niche widths indicated greater dietary differences between western and eastern Hudson Bay with warming, suggesting a possible ecological divergence related to climate change.},

	abstract = {We used Mayfield logistic regression and an information-theoretic approach to examine habitat characteristics associated with nesting success of Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) across an urban to forested gradient in southwestern Pennsylvania in 2003 and 2004. Both nest placement and number of understory stems provided equally plausible models. Mayfield success was 20\% higher for nests {\textgreater}3 m above ground level while dense understory was associated with low nest height. Wood Thrush nests in the forest interior averaged 2 m higher with a third less understory than edge nests. Urbanization and distance to the forest edge were not useful predictors of Wood Thrush nest success. The analysis was confounded by low breeding density at the most urbanized sites, but we found moderate success (42\%, n = 63) across a fragmented landscape with minimal core forest area. Interior nests in a large contiguous forest were twice as successful (60\%, n = 31) compared to edge nests (25\%, n = 33) adjacent to a small housing development. We do not know the mechanism underlying increased predation of low understory nest sites that we observed. The ability of Wood Thrushes to see and/or effectively attack a predator in the area may be important for nest defense; changes in the predator community associated with forest edges may also explain differences in nest success. The relationship between nest placement, nest defense, and the predator community needs further study.},

	volume = {11},
	doi = {10.2307/3060920},
	abstract = {Eastern deciduous forests have been invaded by two exotic species that often dominate the understory vegetation. Berberis thunbergii, a woody shrub. forms dense thickets, while Microstegium vimineum, a C-4 grass, forms continuous lawns; the two species often co-occur. We hypothesized that a variety of characteristics of the exotic species may cause soil-based ecosystem processes to change following invasion, and that such changes could establish positive feedback processes that enhance the spread of the exotic. We examined changes in soil {pH}, nitrogen cycling, and litter dynamics in stands infested with both species in three locations in northern New Jersey ({USA}). Soils directly beneath each of the two exotics had higher {pH} values and higher nitrification rates and often had higher net N mineralization rates than did soils beneath adjacent patches of the most common native understory shrub, Vaccinium pallidum. These differences could be replicated in the greenhouse by growing the exotics in previously uninvaded soils. Berberis litter was much higher in N concentration than was litter of the native species; it decomposed more rapidly than litter of native dominant tree species, with little or no immobilization of N. In contrast, Microstegium litter decomposed more slowly than the native species' litters, and it immobilized N. We suggest that the same change in soil-increased {pH} and nitrification-result from different combinations of mechanisms in the two exotic species. Both species evidently favor uptake of nitrate. which may elevate {pH}. However, Berberis combines large biomasses of N-rich roots with N-rich leaf litter, while Microstegium populations combines small biomasses of N-rich roots with small biomasses of N-poor litter that leave much of the surface soil with few roots. The ability to change soil functions may be an important and previously unrecognized characteristic that renders species capable of invading intact communities, while the likelihood that changes in soil functions can alter the growth of the exotics may be an important component of invasibility.},

	abstract = {A forest-stream trophic link was examined by stable carbon isotope analyses which evaluated the relationship of aquatic insects emerging from a stream to the diets of web-building spiders. Spiders, aquatic and terrestrial prey, and basal resources of forest and stream food webs were collected in a deciduous forest along a Japanese headwater stream during May and July 2001. The delta(13)C analyses suggested that riparian tetragnathid spiders relied on aquatic insects and that the monthly variation of such dependence is partly associated with the seasonal dynamics of aquatic insect abundance in the riparian forest. Similarly, linyphiid spiders in the riparian forest exhibited delta(13)C values similar to aquatic prey in May. However, their delta(13)C values were close to terrestrial prey in both riparian and upland (150 m away from the stream) forests during June to July, suggesting the seasonal incorporation of stream-derived carbon into their tissue. In contrast, araneid spiders relied on terrestrial prey in both riparian and upland forests throughout the study period. These isotopic results were consistent with a previous study that reported seasonal variation in the aquatic prey contribution to total web contents for each spider group in this forest, implying that spiders assimilate trapped prey and that aquatic insect flux indeed contributes to the energetics of riparian tetragnathid and linyphiid spiders.},

	abstract = {Forest edges are often associated with a high risk of brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), but the extent to which this vulnerability changes across the breeding season is poorly understood. We evaluated temporal variability in the relationship between distance to habitat edges and risk of brood parasitism. From 2008-2010, we monitored parasitism of 347 nests of Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) at 19 forested sites within the urbanizing landscapes of central Ohio. For each nest, we measured distance to the nearest edge (e.g., road, residential area, mowed field, agriculture, and natural area) and recorded when clutches were initiated. We found that risk of parasitism associated with edges varied with time of season. Early in the breeding season, risk of parasitism declined with increasing distance from edges. However, late in the breeding season, nests farther from edges had higher rates of parasitism. These patterns suggest that early in the season, cowbirds search for forest nests along residential and agricultural edges, whereas later in the season, cowbirds search the interior. Our results show that managers should consider temporal factors in generalizing about the risk that edges pose to nests.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00442-005-0066-8},
	abstract = {Animals with high metabolic rates are believed to have high rates of carbon and nitrogen isotopic incorporation. We hypothesized that (1) chronic exposure to cold, and hence an increase in metabolic rate, would increase the rate of isotopic incorporation of both (13)C and (15)N into red blood cells; and (2) that the rate of isotopic incorporation into red blood cells would be allometrically related to body mass. Two groups of sparrows were chronically exposed to either 5 or 22 degrees C and switched from a (13)C-depleted C(3)-plant diet to a more (13)C-enriched C(4)-plant one. We used respirometry to estimate the resting metabolic rate ((V)over dot(O 2)) of birds exposed chronically to our two experimental temperatures. The allometric relationship between the rate of (13)C incorporation into blood and body mass was determined from published data. The (V)over dot(O 2) of birds at 5 degrees C was 1.9 times higher than that of birds at 22 degrees C. Chronic exposure to a low temperature did not have an effect on the rate of isotopic incorporation of (15)N save for a very small effect on the incorporation of (13)C. The isotopic incorporation rate of (13)C was 1.5 times faster than that of (15)N. The fractional rate of (13)C incorporation into avian blood was allometrically related to body mass with an exponent similar to -1/4. We conclude that the relationship between metabolic rate and the rate of isotopic incorporation into an animal's tissues is indirect. It is probably mediated by protein turnover and thus more complex than previous studies have assumed.},

Determining the most frequently used migration routes and nonbreeding regions for a species is critical for understanding population dynamics and making effective conservation decisions. We tracked the migration of individual Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) (n = 102) from across their range with light-level geolocators and, for the first time, quantified migration routes and wintering regions for distinct breeding populations. We identified regional and species-level migratory connectivity networks for this declining songbird by combining our tracking results with range-wide breeding abundance estimates and forest cover data. More than 50\% of the species occupied the eastern wintering range (Honduras to Costa Rica), a region that includes only one-third of all wintering habitat and that is undergoing intensive deforestation. We estimated that half of all Wood Thrushes in North America migrate south through Florida in fall, whereas in spring approximately 73\% funnel northward through a narrow span along the central U.S. Gulf Coast (88–93°W). Identifying migratory networks is a critical step for conservation of songbirds and we demonstrated with Wood Thrushes how it can highlight conservation hotspots for regional populations and species as a whole.

We sampled arthropods at the same sites where diet data were collected, and compared abundance and biomass of prey among seven common shrub species. Wilson's Warblers ate more caterpillars (Lepidoptera larvae), flies (Diptera), beetles (Coleoptera), and Homoptera than expected based on availability. Deciduous shrubs supported higher abundances of arthropod taxa and size classes used as prey by Wilson's Warblers than did evergreen shrubs.

	abstract = {Sugar maple, Acer saccharum, decline disease is incited by multiple disturbance factors when imbalanced calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and manganese (Mn) act as predisposing stressors. Our objective in this study was to determine whether factors affecting sugar maple health also affect growth as estimated by basal area increment ({BAI}). We used 76 northern hardwood stands in northern Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire, {USA}, and found that sugar maple growth was positively related to foliar concentrations of Ca and Mg and stand level estimates of sugar maple crown health during a high stress period from 1987 to 1996. Foliar nutrient threshold values for Ca, Mg, and Mn were used to analyze long-term {BAI} trends from 1937 to 1996. Significant (P ≤ 0.05) nutrient threshold-by-time interactions indicate changing growth in relation to nutrition during this period. Healthy sugar maples sampled in the 1990s had decreased growth in the 1970s, 10–20 years in advance of the 1980s and 1990s decline episode in Pennsylvania. Even apparently healthy stands that had no defoliation, but had below-threshold amounts of Ca or Mg and above-threshold Mn (from foliage samples taken in the mid 1990s), had decreasing growth by the 1970s. Co-occurring black cherry, Prunus serotina, in a subset of the Pennsylvania and New York stands, showed opposite growth responses with greater growth in stands with below-threshold Ca and Mg compared with above-threshold stands. Sugar maple growing on sites with the highest concentrations of foliar Ca and Mg show a general increase in growth from 1937 to 1996 while other stands with lower Ca and Mg concentrations show a stable or decreasing growth trend. We conclude that acid deposition induced changes in soil nutrient status that crossed a threshold necessary to sustain sugar maple growth during the 1970s on some sites. While nutrition of these elements has not been considered in forest management decisions, our research shows species specific responses to Ca and Mg that may reduce health and growth of sugar maple or change species composition, if not addressed.},

We established the turnover rates of C-13 in tissues of grown Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) by switching the diet of an experimental group from a wheat-based (C3) diet to a corn-based (C4) diet and sampled tissues periodically for 212 days. An exponential model described patterns of isotopic turnover in all tissues. Turnover rates for quail tissues were ranked liver {\textgreater} blood {\textgreater} muscle {\textgreater} bone collagen with the half life of carbon ranging from 2.6 days in liver to 173.3 days in bone collagen. A similar diet-switch experiment was conducted on captive American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and feather samples were assayed isotopically. Stable isotope values of crow feathers reflected diet during periods of growth. We suggest that stable isotope analysis could be used to determine relative contributions of endogenous and exogenous nutrient sources for feather growth and egg production in captive and wild birds.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have assessed the individual effects of prey nutritional quality or chemical defenses on consumer feeding behavior. However, little is known about how these traits interact to affect consumer feeding and performance. We tested the separate and interactive effects of prey chemical defenses and nutritional quality on the feeding behavior and fitness of six sympatric crustacean mesograzers. Natural concentrations of diterpene alcohols (dictyols) from the brown alga Dictyota menstrualis were incorporated, or not incorporated, into lower quality and higher quality foods to create artificial diets mimicking prey of variable value and defense. Five amphipods (Ampithoe longimana, A. valida, Cymadusa compta, Gammarus mucronatus, and Elasmopus levis) and one isopod (Paracerceis caudata), representing a continuum of closely to distantly related organisms, were fed intact algae or lower and higher quality diets containing or lacking dictyols. All six mesograzers preferred the green alga Enteromorpha intestinalis to the dictyol producing alga Dictyota menstrualis. In assays allowing consumers to choose between simultaneously available foods, dictyols deterred feeding by all five amphipods, but not the isopod; this occurred for both lower and higher quality foods. In no-choice assays, where consumers were confined with only one of our four treatment diets, effects on feeding became more complex. Nutritional quality alone affected feeding by five of the six species. These grazers compensated for lower quality by increasing consumption. Dictyols suppressed feeding for four of the six species. More interestingly, there were significant dictyol × quality interactions for three species. Dictyols decreased feeding more when placed in lower quality foods than higher quality foods. Two amphipods deterred by dictyols in the choice assays readily consumed dictyol-containing foods in no-choice situations and suffered few negative effects of doing so. Although all amphipods were deterred by dictyols in choice assays, dictyols decreased fitness (survivorship, growth, or reproduction) for only four of the five species. These effects included large and immediate decreases in survivorship, dramatic effects on reproduction, and modest effects on female growth. Dictyols enhanced survivorship of the isopod. Thus, the effects of secondary metabolites on feeding in choice situations vs. fitness in long-term assays were inconsistent. For three amphipods, certain effects of food quality, dictyols, or their interaction were detected only for females. In general, negative effects of dictyols on fitness were greater in lower than in higher quality foods, suggesting that prey nutritional value may counteract the effects of defensive metabolites. For example, when G. mucronatus consumed dictyols in lower quality foods, mortality was {\textgreater}80\% by day 5; for dictyols in higher quality foods, 80\% mortality took 28 days to develop. Lower quality foods alone significantly decreased growth for the isopod, three of the amphipods, and the females of a fourth amphipod, concomitantly reducing fecundity for four of the five amphipods studied. The effects of both chemical defenses and nutritional quality were unrelated to consumer phylogeny; responses of congeners varied as much, or more, than responses of more distantly related consumers. Understanding mechanisms and consequences of food selection requires that the interactive effects of both chemical defenses and prey nutritional characteristics be considered explicitly.

We argue that this is due to inappropriate methods used to forecast required compensation in environmental impact assessments. These assessments are mostly descriptive and only valid at limited spatial and temporal scales. However, habitat suitability models developed to predict the impacts of environmental changes on potential species' distributions should provide rigorous science-based tools for compensation planning. Here we describe the two main classes of predictive models: correlative models and individual-based mechanistic models. We show how these models can be used alone or synoptically to improve compensation planning. While correlative models are easier to implement, they tend to ignore underlying ecological processes and lack accuracy. On the contrary, individual-based mechanistic models can integrate biological interactions, dispersal ability and adaptation. Moreover, among mechanistic models, those considering animal energy balance are particularly efficient at predicting the impact of foraging habitat loss. However, mechanistic models require more field data compared to correlative models. Hence we present two approaches which combine both methods for compensation planning, especially in relation to the spatial scale considered. We show how the availability of biological databases and software enabling fast and accurate population projections could be advantageously used to assess ecological compensation requirement efficiently in environmental impact assessments.},

	title = {Seasonal interactions, habitat quality, and population dynamics in migratory birds},
	volume = {109},
	abstract = {Historically, studies of habitat selection have focused on quantifying how current patterns of habitat occupancy influence condition and survival within a season. This approach however, is overly simplistic, especially for migratory birds that spend different periods of the year in geographically distinct places. Habitat occupancy and the resulting condition of individual birds is likely to be affected by events in the previous season, and the consequences of habitat occupancy will influence individuals and populations in subsequent seasons. Thus, for migratory birds, variation in habitat quality (and quantity) needs to be understood in the context of how events interact throughout periods of the annual cycle. Seasonal interactions can occur at the individual level or population level. Individual-level interactions occur when events in one season produce nonlethal, residual effects that carry over to influence individuals the following season. Population-level interactions occur when a change in population size in one season influences per capita rates the following season. We review various methods for estimating seasonal interactions and highlight a number of examples in the literature. Using a variety of techniques, including intrinsic and extrinsic markers, the vast majority of studies to date have measured seasonal interactions at the individual level. Obtaining estimates of density and changes in per capita rates across multiple seasons to determine population-level interactions has been more challenging. Both types of seasonal interactions can influence population dynamics, but predicting their effects requires detailed knowledge of how populations are geographically connected (i.e., migratory connectivity). We recommend that researchers studying habitat occupancy and habitat selection consider how events in previous seasons influence events within a season.},

In addition to reviewing key findings relevant to each state factor, we note the emergence of tentative "urban syndromes" concerning soils, streams, wildlife and plants, and homogenization of certain ecosystem functions, such as soil organic carbon dynamics. We note the utility of the ecosystem approach, the human ecosystem framework, and watersheds as integrative tools to tie information about multiple state factors together. The organismal component of urban complexes includes the social organization of the human population, and we review key modes by which human populations within urban areas are differentiated, and how such differentiation affects environmentally relevant actions. Emerging syntheses in land change science and ecological urban design are also summarized. The multifaceted frameworks and the growing urban knowledge base do however identify some pressing research needs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) nest records from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology were used to test whether rates of parasitism and the number of cowbird eggs or young per parasitized nest varied regionally with distance from the historic range of the cowbird. Rates of parasitism differed significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) among the Midwest (42. 1\%), Mid-Atlantic (26.5\%), and Northeast (14.7\%). Mean number of cowbird eggs or young per parasitized nest differed significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) among regions and displayed similar regional trends with means of 2.09, 1.64, and 1.21, respectively. Rates of parasitism were correlated positively (r 0.64, P = 0.002) with relative abundance of cowbirds and negatively cor-related (r = -0.70, P = 0.001) with relative abundance of Wood Thrush. In the Midwest, relative abundance of cowbirds was significantly higher and Wood Thrushes significantly lower than in the other two regions. Because of the high abundance of cowbirds, high percentage of nests parasitized, and high number of cowbird eggs per parasitized nest, the effects of cowbird parasitism are particularly severe in the Midwest.},

	abstract = {The widespread omnivory of consumers and the trophic complexity of marine ecosystems make it difficult to infer the feeding ecology of species. The use of stable isotopic analysis plays a crucial role in elucidating trophic interactions. Here we analysed delta(15)N, delta(13)C and delta(34)S in chick feathers, and we used a Bayesian triple-isotope mixing model to reconstruct the diet of a generalist predator, the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) that breeds in the coastal upwelling area off northwest mainland Spain. The mixing model indicated that although chicks from all colonies were fed with a high percentage of fish, there are geographical differences in their diets. While chicks from northern colonies consume higher percentages of earthworms, refuse constitutes a more important source in the diet of chicks from western colonies. The three-isotope mixing model revealed a heterogeneity in foraging habitats that would not have been apparent if only two stable isotopes had been analysed. Moreover, our work highlights the potential of adding delta(34)S for distinguishing not only between terrestrial and marine prey, but also between different marine species such as fish, crabs and mussels.},

Here, we draw on recent mechanistic ecological studies to argue that, in addition to altered habitat structure, three major processes contribute to the patterns of reduced species diversity and elevated abundance of many species in urban environments. These activities, in turn, lead to changes in animal behavior, morphology and genetics, as well as in selection pressures on animals and plants. Thus, the key to understanding urban patterns is to balance studying processes at the individual level with an integrated examination of environmental forces at the ecosystem scale.},

	abstract = {Roadside point counts are often used to estimate trends of bird populations. The use of aural counts of birds without adjustment for detection probability, however, can lead to incorrect population trend estimates. We compared precision of estimates of density and detectability of whistling northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) using distance sampling, independent double-observer, and removal methods from roadside surveys. Two observers independently recorded each whistling bird heard, distance from the observer, and time of first detection at 362 call-count stops in Ohio. We examined models that included covariates for year and observer effects for each method and distance from observer effects for the double-observer and removal methods using Akaike's Information Criterion ({AIC}). The best model of detectability from distance sampling included observer and year effects. The best models from the removal and double-observer techniques included observer and distance effects. All 3 methods provided precise estimates of detection probability ({CV} = 2.4-4.4\%) with a range of detectability of 0.44-0.95 for a 6-min survey. Density estimates from double-observer surveys had the lowest coefficient of variation (2005 = 3.2\%, 2006 = 1.7\%), but the removal method also provided precise estimates of density (2005 {CV} = 3.4\%, 2006 {CV} = 4.8\%), and density estimates from distance sampling were less precise (2005 {CV} = 9.6\%, 2006 {CV} = 7.9\%). Assumptions of distance sampling were violated in our study because probability of detecting bobwhites near the observer was {\textless}1 or the roadside survey points were not randomly distributed with respect to the birds. Distances also were not consistently recorded by individual members of observer pairs. Although double-observer surveys provided more precise estimates, we recommend using the removal method to estimate detectability and abundance of bobwhites. The removal method provided precise estimates of density and detection probability and requires half the personnel time as double-observer surveys. Furthermore, the likelihood of meeting model assumptions is higher for the removal survey than with independent double-observers. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {For Neotropical migrants, rates of nest survival and brood parasitism are thought to decline with the area of the forest fragment in which the birds nest. Using the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), we conducted the first test of the "area" hypothesis based on direct measures of annual production and related demographics of marked individuals. We predicted that productivity per female and per ha, proportion of females nesting successfully each year, and return rates of adults would decrease and that rates of nest predation and brood parasitism and the ratio of yearlings:older adults would increase with a decrease in area of forest. Intensive season-long banding, nest finding, and nest monitoring to determine the annual production of all residents yielded data for two annual (1991 and 1992) tests in which we compared mean results from 14 small fragments (less than or equal to 2.1 ha) with those from a 15-ha site, the University of Delaware Woods ({UDW}). Fledglings per female and per ha, and percent of females fledging greater than or equal to 2 young per year, were lower, and percent of nests lost to predation and percent of nests parasitized were higher, in small fragments than in the larger tract at {UDW} in both years. The ratio of yearlings:older adults was significantly higher in small fragments for males and tended to be so for females in 1991, but neither result occurred in 1992. Return rate for each sex was lower in small fragments in the only year tested. The 17.5 ha of small fragments collectively produced many fewer young per female and per ha than the 15-ha {UDW}. Three analyses indicated that the small fragments were population sinks, whereas {UDW} probably was a source of recruits. Although a few small fragments equaled the {UDW} in some measures of quality, our data support the area hypothesis in relation to quality of breeding habitat.},

We determined delta-C-13 and delta-N-15 diet-tissue fractionation factors for blood, liver. muscle, bone collagen and feathers of domestic chickens (Gallus gallus), Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) and Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) and for blood and feather samples of adult Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) raised on known isotopic diets. In most cases tissues were enriched in delta-C-13 and delta-N-15 compared to diet. However, fractionation values differed among species, diets, and tissue types and this variation must be considered in isotope dietary studies. We found little evidence that isotopic fractionation factors are influenced by age in adult birds and provide fractionation factors appropriate for granivores feeding in a C-3 biome and for higher trophic-level piscivores and carnivores. American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) raised on a perch diet grew faster and showed lower nitrogen diet-tissue fractionation values than crows raised on a plant-based diet. We suggest that nutritional stress caused substantial increases in diet-tissue fractionation values due either to: (1) mobilization and redeposition of proteins elsewhere in the body; or (2) amino acid composition changes in tissues.},

Passerines acquire calcium shortly before and during laying and do not store calcium for egg formation. Many passerines need to cat extraneous calcium in the form of snail shells or calcareous grit to acquire the element. However, very little is known about variation in the dependency of birds on extraneous calcium, and where this calcium is acquired. Using reports from volunteers who provided extraneous calcium sources at feeder sites across North America we documented that (1) the use of extraneous calcium varied during the breeding season; (2) the location in which species preferentially took the calcium varied with typical feeding location, aside from swallows which, somewhat surprisingly, favored calcium offered on the ground; (3) Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) did not visit calcium sites more often than other blackbirds; (4) calcium use varied among species with thrushes, wrens, and woodpeckers taking calcium only rarely, and swallows, pigeons, and corvids taking calcium frequently. The most surprising result perhaps was the very high frequency of calcium use in jays; Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata) may hoard calcium in the fall.},

	abstract = {Methods for the estimation of earthworm population densities range from laborious handsorting, through chemical applications, to electrical extraction. Of these methods, only the electrical extraction allows for sampling of earthworms without detrimental soil disturbance or contamination. However, a device to extract earthworms under controlled electronic conditions is not readily available to researchers. An improved design on the long-established electrical "octet" extraction device is presented. This improved design allows for hand-built construction of an apparatus that can be connected to external drive controls, including data loggers and {PC}-controlled drivers. This design also allows for modification of sampling settings to suit specific environmental conditions, with control of voltage, and operation with a static or dynamic electrical field being generated. Operational ability to extract earthworms was validated in field trials in both a forested area and an agricultural field. Earthworm sampling efficiencies calculated in comparison to hand-sorting averaged around 90\% for the electrical device; however, because of limited field use in this instance, these efficiencies support the general functioning of the apparatus rather than an absolute assurance of quality. In using this hand-built device we established that this design is capable of extracting both native and exotic earthworms of various age and size class under various soil conditions, that soil disturbance and contamination can be avoided, and that the device can easily be transported into remote locations.},

	abstract = {Dynamic extinction colonisation models (also called contact processes) are widely studied in epidemiology and in metapopulation theory. Contacts are usually assumed to be possible only through a network of connected patches. This network accounts for a spatial landscape or a social organization of interactions. Thanks to social network literature, heterogeneous networks of contacts can be considered. A major issue is to assess the influence of the network in the dynamic model. Most work with this common purpose uses deterministic models or an approximation of a stochastic Extinction-Colonisation model ({sEC}) which are relevant only for large networks. When working with a limited size network, the induced stochasticity is essential and has to be taken into account in the conclusions. Here, a rigorous framework is proposed for limited size networks and the limitations of the deterministic approximation are exhibited. This framework allows exact computations when the number of patches is small. Otherwise, simulations are used and enhanced by adapted simulation techniques when necessary. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare four main topologies of networks in contrasting settings to determine the role of the network. A challenging case was studied in this context: seed exchange of crop species in the Reseau Semences Paysannes ({RSP}), an emergent French farmers׳ organisation. A stochastic Extinction-Colonisation model was used to characterize the consequences of substantial changes in terms of {RSP}׳s social organization on the ability of the system to maintain crop varieties.},

	abstract = {Many studies investigating edge effects on forest-nesting birds have focused on nest success. Fewer have examined edge effects on other components of fitness. Nestling growth rates have been positively correlated with food availability, which may differ at edges compared to the forest interior. However, previous work has not examined growth as a function of distance to edge and edge type. We investigated whether edge type, distance to edge, hatching date, brood size, brood parasitism, year, and site influenced growth rates of wings, tarsi, and mass of nestling Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) using regression tree analyses. Simultaneously, we examined edge effects on daily nest survival. We conducted our study in southwestern Michigan in 2002 and 2003. We located 175 nests and measured nestlings from 61 nests. Contrary to expectations, tarsal and mass growth rates were more rapid near edges than in the forest interior and tarsal growth rates were more rapid near gradual edge types than near abrupt edge types. Wing chord growth rates were more rapid in the forest interior than at edges. Mass and tarsal growth rates were more rapid later in the breeding season, when brood sizes were smaller. We found no effect of edge type or distance to edge on nest survival. The influence of edge on nestling growth rate but not nest survival suggests nestling growth rates may indicate edge-interior and edge type differences in habitat quality, even when high regional fragmentation levels overwhelm potential edge-interior differences in nest survival.},

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification has been linked to declines in farmland and grassland bird populations in Europe and in North America. One factor thought to be behind these declines is reduced invertebrate food abundance in the breeding season, leading to reduced reproductive success. However, little is known about foraging habitat or diet of farmland birds in North America. We used stable isotopes to study foraging habitat and diet of Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia (A. Wilson, 1810)), a common hedgerow-breeding bird, by collecting claw clippings of Song Sparrow nestlings from farms in eastern Ontario, Canada. Mean values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 were compared between claws and invertebrate food sources from adjacent land-cover types, using a Bayesian mixing model. The portion of nestling diet that came from seminatural and forage habitats was higher than expected, based on the proportion of seminatural and forage cover at the nest. This was particularly evident at nests with low seminatural cover, where hedgerows were the only noncrop habitat. The most important food sources for Song Sparrow nestlings were hoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) and caterpillars (Lepidoptera). Management actions to increase invertebrate abundance in hedgerows may benefit Song Sparrows and other farmland birds with minimal impact on crop yield.},

	abstract = {Attention to long-term declines in populations of Neotropical migratory birds has generated increased interest in how to monitor and manage them. Measurement of nesting success provides information on trends in recruitment, and measurement of vegetation associated with nests may identify habitat influences on breeding productivity. Examination of nests also allows collection of life history data (e.g., clutch size, numbers of broods, numbers of nesting attempts, nesting success), which provide important insight into vulnerability of species to decimation or pertubations. Comparisons of nesting success and habitat use across the geographic range of a species can determine local habitat effects on population recruitment and historical constraints on habitat use and species distributions. In this paper, standardized methods and cues are described that aid in locating and monitoring nests to allow comparisons across studies in space and time.},

While the source of the fundamental failure remains elusive, mitigating solutions are suggested for dealing with additional unquantified variation.

	abstract = {Research into population declines of North American bird species has mainly focused on the fragmentation of habitat on the breeding or wintering grounds [Robinson, S. K., Thompson, F. R., Donovan, T. M., Whitehead, D. R. \& Faaborg, J. (1995) Science 267, 1987-1990]. In contrast, research into declines of European species has mainly focused on intensification of agriculture [Donald, P. F., Green, R. E. \& Heath, M. F. (2001) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 268, 25-29] and the role played by the atmospheric deposition of pollutants, in particular, acid rain [Graveland, J. (11998) Environ. Rev. 6. 41-54]. However, despite widespread unexplained declines of bird populations in regions of heavy wet acid ion deposition [Sauer, J. R., Hines, J. E. \& Fallon, J. (2001) The North American Breeding Bird Survey Results and Analysis 1966-2000 (Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, {MD})], no North American studies have presented evidence linking such widespread terrestrial bird declines to acid rain. To address the question of the role played by acid rain in population declines of eastern North American songbird species, we combine data from several sources. We use a multiple logistic regression model to test for adverse effects of acid rain on the Wood Thrush, while controlling for regional abundance, landscape-level habitat fragmentation, elevation, soil {pH}, and vegetation. We show a strong, highly significant, negative effect of acid rain on the predicted probability of breeding by this species, and interactions with elevation, low {pH} soils, and habitat fragmentation that worsen these negative effects. Our results suggest an important role for acid rain in recent declines of some birds breeding in the eastern United States, particularly in high elevation zones with low {pH} soils, and show the need to consider other large-scale influences, in addition to habitat fragmentation, when addressing bird population declines.},

	abstract = {The measurement of stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in tissues of marine consumers can provide trophic-level information that is a time-integrated approximation of assimilated diet. By measuring {deltaN}-15 and delta-C-13 concentrations in liver, muscle and bone collagen of 7 species of seabirds inhabiting the Barrow Strait - Lancaster Sound region, Northwest Territories, Canada, estimates of short-, intermediate-, and long-term trophic level ({TL}), respectively, were established. Trophic estimates were based on a simple model incorporating diet-tissue fractionation established through the captive rearing of piscivorous birds on known isotopic diets. {DeltaC}-13 was not a useful indicator of trophic position in this marine food web but may indicate inshore or benthic vs offshore or pelagic feeding preferences in seabirds. {DeltaN}-15 was a useful indicator and ranged from 12.7 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand ({TL} 3.3) in liver of dovekies Alle alle to 19.1 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand in the bone collagen of glaucous gulls Larus hyperboreus. Consistent with their known diets, dovekies and common eiders Somateria mollissima showed lowest trophic positions for all tissues; black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, thick-billed murres Uria lomvia, northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis and black guillemots Cepphus grylle showed intermediate trophic positions ({TL} 3.9 to 4.3) and glaucous gulls showed highest trophic position ({TL} 4.5 to 4.8). In general, seabirds increased their consumption of lower-trophic-level invertebrates during the breeding season over their lifetime averages but fed their chicks diets consisting of high proportions of fish. Isotopic estimates suggest greater dependence on lower-trophic-level prey by murres, fulmars, kittiwakes and guillemots than previously established through conventional dietary techniques.},

We observed such predators as black rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta), American Grows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans), and black bears (Ursus americanus) remove the contents of nests. Camera installation had no measurable effect on nest survival; daily nest survival was approximately 0.96 for nests with and without cameras. However, placement of an artificial egg trigger in the nest appeared to reduce hatching success. The immobile egg trigger might have interfered with the female Wood Thrush's ability to incubate her eggs. The variety of nest predators observed and the moderate daily survival rates recorded suggest that predation is an important constraint on Wood Thrushes nesting in large contiguous forests.},

	abstract = {Several different techniques have been used to study the diet composition of skuas and gulls in polar regions. In this study, we assessed the diet of great skuas using five techniques (pellets, prey remains, spontaneous regurgitates, observed feeds and water off-loading). The estimates of diet derived from each sampling technique during a single breeding season were generally similar. Although it is easy to collect large samples of pellets and remains, these over-estimate the amount of indigestible material in the diet. Prey remains provide a high degree of taxonomic accuracy, but may under-estimate prey swallowed whole. Water off-loading provides unbiased estimates of chick diet but only during a short period in the breeding season. It may also stress birds, and is labour-intensive. Spontaneous regurgitates are useful for assessing chick and adult diet but are difficult to collect systematically, and differing prey digestibility may bias results. Observed feeds are time consuming to record and over-represent easily identifiable prey. Technique-dependent biases highlight that sampling methods should be selected on the basis of sample sizes, time, taxonomic detail and age of study birds. Biomass may be estimated using pellets with correction factors, and also spontaneous regurgitates and water off-loading, but prey remains and observed feeds may be more inaccurate.},

Bird censuses each year for 5 years revealed that {YT} supported the lowest total avian density of the three suburbs; {OP} supported the greatest variety and total density of insectivores, and the lowest number of ground-gleaning omnivores; and {MT} supported the highest total avian density, comprised primarily of ground-foraging seed eaters and omnivores. Among nesting guilds, {OP} contained the fewest ground/herb nesters, and {MT} the most. Also, {OP} had the fewest shrub nesters, and {MT} the most. Tree cavity and twig nesters were significantly more numerous in {OP}, and tree branch nesters fewer in {YT} than in either {OP} or {MT}. Analyses of habitat structure revealed that shrub maturity is more important than numbers of shrubs, and that planted trees, no matter how mature or abundant, do not replace natural forest stands as habitat for most insectivorous species.},

	doi = {10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[0868:CWIOAG]2.0.CO;2},
	abstract = {Many ecologists have searched for species that contribute strongly to the structure and composition of communities of organisms. It has been speculated that the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), a generalist brood parasite, is capable of changing songbird communities. Cowbird parasitism may reduce numbers of suitable hosts, i.e., songbirds that accept cowbird eggs and raise cowbird young. In contrast, songbird species that eject cowbird eggs, nest in cavities, feed their nestlings mainly seeds or fruits, or are too big to parasitize, should escape the effects of cowbird parasitism. Thus, cowbirds may change the composition of songbird communities by selectively depressing numbers of suitable host individuals and species. We tested this hypothesis using an existing cowbird removal program in the state of Michigan, {USA}. This program was designed to protect the endangered Kirtland's Warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii) from cowbird parasitism throughout its 19 200-km(2) breeding range. We compared songbird community composition in stands of young jack pine (Pinus bnnksiana) where cowbirds had been removed for 5-11 yr to communities in Control sites 5-10 km from cowbird traps and {\textgreater}10 km from cowbird traps. We predicted that cowbird Removal sites would support greater songbird richness and evenness and a greater proportion of suitable host vs. unsuitable host individuals relative to Control sites. Results from songbird point counts revealed that species richness and evenness were very similar at cowbird Removal and Control sites and that Removal sites contained only 4.0-8.7\% more suitable host individuals than Control sites. Our results suggest that cowbirds do not strongly influence the composition of songbird communities in jack pine forests of Michigan. Several factors may explain a lack of community-wide response to long-term cowbird removal, including the population dynamics of songbirds on a broader scale. We conclude that there is little support for adding cowbirds to the short list of species that can regulate entire communities. Our results have implications for the increasingly widespread use of cowbird removal as a management tool.},

	abstract = {The exchange of energy and nutrients between ecosystems (i.e., resource subsidies) plays a central role in ecological dynamics over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Little attention has been paid to the role of anthropogenic impacts on natural systems in altering the magnitude, timing, and quality of resource subsidies. Kelp ecosystems are highly productive on a local scale and export over 80\% of kelp primary production as detritus, subsidizing consumers across broad spatial scales. Here, we generate a model of detrital production from a kelp bed in Nova Scotia to hindcast trends in detrital production based on temperature and wave height recorded in the study region from 1976 to 2009, and to project changes in detrital production that may result from future climate change. Historical and projected increases in temperature and wave height led to higher rates of detrital production through increased blade breakage and kelp dislodgment from the substratum, but this reduced kelp biomass and led to a decline in detrital production in the long term. We also used the model to demonstrate that the phase shift from a highly productive kelp bed to a low-productivity barrens, driven by the grazing activity of sea urchins, reduces kelp detrital production by several orders of magnitude, an effect that would be exacerbated by projected increases in temperature and wave action. These results indicate that climate-mediated changes in ecological dynamics operating on local scales may alter the magnitude of resource subsidies to adjacent ecosystems, affecting ecological dynamics on regional scales.},
